# Pluralsight Wordpress Custom Theme Development Class  by Susan Simkins

This class covers building a custom theme for a wordpress site from initial prototype
to finished product and deployment.  The project is for a fictional design agency
and involves a handful of pages, some of which are handled by plugins and several of
which are built from scratch as custom pages.

Simkins takes us from the initial mock ups to the design, although the CSS is already
built, and HTML/CSS skills are assumed for the student.  This is not a design class.
But getting these styles plugged into the Wordpress site is explained and deployment
is shown along with the PHP integration.
